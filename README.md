# BAN 6003 Weeks 3-4: Data Cleaning, Reproducibility, Governance, and Ethics

**BAN 6003: Data Management and Analytics Integration**  
**Weeks 3-4 GitHub Template**

This repository contains the notebooks, data files, environment files, and local check scripts for this assignment package. Detailed lab instructions are provided in Canvas/LMS.

## Canvas / LMS Lab Guide

Read the Canvas/LMS lab guide before working in this repository. The LMS page contains the detailed workflow, submission instructions, and any module-specific notes. This README is only a quick repository checklist.

## Required Notebooks

- `notebooks/week3_data_cleaning_lab.ipynb`
- `notebooks/week4_github_repro_governance_lab.ipynb`

## Required Input File

- `data/raw/employee_data.csv`, the protected raw dataset shared by both labs

The template does not include completed outputs. Running the notebooks creates:

- `data/processed/employee_data_cleaned_week3.csv`
- `data/processed/employee_data_dictionary.csv`
- `data/processed/employee_review_copy_no_names.csv`

## How to Work

1. Create your own GitHub repository from this template.
2. Use GitHub Codespaces as the main working environment. If you are technically experienced, you may use local conda + VS Code instead.
3. Install dependencies with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` if working locally.
4. Open the notebooks in the order listed above.
5. Run cells from top to bottom.
6. Complete all `Your Turn`, offline assignment, exercise, checkpoint, and reflection sections.
7. Save your notebooks and required outputs.
8. Submit your GitHub repository link through Canvas.

## Completion Check

Your instructor may run a local completion and reproducibility check after submission. The check is designed to support the automatic portion of the lab grade. It verifies that required files exist, notebooks run when possible, marked code cells have real code, required output-producing cells have output after execution, and written response placeholders have been replaced.

The check does not evaluate the quality of your interpretation. Your instructor may grade the remaining portion manually using the assignment rubric.


## Submit

Submit your GitHub repository link through Canvas before the deadline. Your repository should be public. If your GitHub repository is private, invite the instructor account `zzz1990771` or `zzz1990771@gmail.com` before submitting the link.

If you are using GitHub, a typical commit workflow is:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Weeks 3-4 BAN 6003 assignment"
git push
```
